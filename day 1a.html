  <!-- Task 4: Poem Display Page -->
  <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
  <p>
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
    <mark>I took the one less traveled by,</mark><br>
    And that has made all the difference.
